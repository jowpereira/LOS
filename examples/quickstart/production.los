# Quickstart Example: Production Optimization
# Minimize total production cost across factories.

import "products.csv"
import "factories.csv"

set Products
set Factories

param Cost[Products]
param Capacity[Factories]

var qty[Products, Factories] >= 0

minimize:
    sum(qty[p,f] * Cost[p] for p in Products, f in Factories)

subject to:
    capacity_limit:
        sum(qty[p,f] for p in Products) <= Capacity[f]
        for f in Factories
